Here’s the combined and updated `README.md` that integrates the session scheduling feature with the Tutor Recommendation System:

# Tutor Recommendation System

## Overview
The Tutor Recommendation System is a web application designed to assist users in finding and rating tutors based on their expertise and subject specialization. The platform enables users to:

- Search and filter tutors by name and subject.
- Register new tutors with detailed information.
- Rate tutors and update their average ratings dynamically.
- View and select from a dynamically populated list of subjects.
- Schedule sessions with preferred tutors.

This project is powered by a Node.js backend using Express.js for routing and JSON files for data storage. The responsive frontend is crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
